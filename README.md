# OwnSpotifyDownload

# For Study Purposes Only !!!

I wrote my own version of Spotdl using python

# How to use: 

Use pip install requirements.txt to download all libraries used in the program

Need to have a chromedriver(default) or edgedriver(need a change in the code)

Remember to have your local ssl certificate ready

You can either run the program or do 'python3 Spotifydl.py https://xxxxxxx', the program accepts link in bash.
